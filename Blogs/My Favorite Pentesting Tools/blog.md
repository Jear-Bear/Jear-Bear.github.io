## How I Use Them Together

These tools work beautifully as a trio:
1. **Pwnagotchi** collects WPA handshakes during passive WiFi reconnaissance.
2. **Wireshark** decrypts and analyzes the captured data for vulnerabilities.
3. **Flipper Zero** enables hardware security testing, such as RFID emulation or signal manipulation.

Combining these tools allows me to conduct thorough pentests across software and hardware layers, ensuring no security flaw is overlooked.
