## 3. [Wireshark and BruteShark](https://www.wireshark.org)

Wireshark is the go-to tool for packet sniffing and network analysis, while BruteShark is a complementary tool that specializes in reconstructing network sessions and decrypting captured data. Together, they form a powerful duo for analyzing network traffic.

### Why I Love Them:
- **Wireshark's Protocol Decoding**: Supports a wide range of protocols for detailed traffic analysis.
- **BruteShark's Reconstruction Abilities**: Extracts credentials, sessions, and files from pcap files.
- **In Conjunction with Pwnagotchi**: After Pwnagotchi collects WPA handshakes, Wireshark and BruteShark make it easy to analyze and reconstruct the captured data, uncovering potential vulnerabilities in network security.
