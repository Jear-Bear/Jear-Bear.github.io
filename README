## Introduction
This website is a personal portfolio designed to highlight my professional background, projects, and accomplishments. It serves as an interactive platform for visitors to learn more about me, explore the projects I've worked on, and find ways to get in touch.

One of the core design principles of this project is responsiveness and interactivity. The site adapts to different screen sizes and provides engaging user experiences such as:
- Dynamic page transitions
- Interactive 3D elements
- Clickable and draggable content
- Custom animations

## Features
- **About Me Section:** This page introduces who I am, my professional background, and my interests. The content is presented in a "notecard" style that visitors can swipe through.
- **Dynamic Page Transitions:** The "About Me" page includes draggable cards for easy navigation through content sections. 
- **Interactive Hexagon Image:** The hexagon image reacts to mouse hover with scaling and shearing effects, creating a medallion-like interaction.
- **Responsive Design:** The site is fully responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes and maintaining a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Pentagon Animation:** Integrated LiquidFun and Babylon.js physics simulations to render images inside pentagons that scale dynamically with the window size.
- **Elastic Particles Simulation:** In some sections, youâ€™ll find interactive elastic particles that add a playful element to the page.

## Technologies Used
- **React** for creating interactive user interfaces.
- **Babylon.js** for rendering 3D objects and visual effects.
- **LiquidFun (Box2D)** for physics simulations and particle animations.
- **HTML5 Canvas** for drawing shapes and overlaying images.
- **JavaScript** for logic and animations.
- **CSS** (using `Poppins` font) for styling and layout.
